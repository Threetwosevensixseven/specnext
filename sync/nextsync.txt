NextSync 0.5

NextSync provides a way to transfer files to the ZX Spectrum Next using
the Next's WIFI module. While it is primarily designed to be a 
development tool, it can be useful for non-developer users of the Next.

NextSync consists of two parts: server running on a desktop machine
and a "dot" command running on the next itself.

The server is implemented in Python 3, and as such should work on any
platform that runs Python (windows, mac, linux, bsd, probably your
fridge).

Setup:
1.  Copy dot/sync from this distribution to your spectrum next sd card
    (into the dot directory).

2.  Copy the specnext.py to the directory on your machine which you
    desire to represent the "root" of the next's filesystem (i.e, the
    sd card). You may also want to copy the syncignore.txt.

3.  Install python 3 if you don't have it (python.org)

4.  Run the server specnext.py. It should show something like the
    following:

Note: Sync point file syncpoint.dat not found, syncing all files regardless of timestamp.
Note: Ready to sync 0 files.

5. Your operating system may ask if you want to let the server
   use the network. Local area network access is sufficient.   
   
6. Make sure the wifi module is working on the next. If you've never
   used it, run the /demos/esp/wifi.bas from the spectrum next sd card.
   After setting up, you can try /demos/NXtel to see if you can 
   connect somewhere. 

7. Open next command line and type .sync and hit enter. It should complain
   that the configuration file is missing.
   
8. Type .sync followed by either your server's host name or ip address.
   Either should work. If more than one ip address is listed, it's possible
   you are on several networks, or have installed VirtualBox or some other
   thingy that creates virtual network interfaces. Use the one that's
   in your local area network. If you use the wrong one, it doesn't matter,
   it just won't work. You can always try the other one later.
   
9. Now you can type .sync without parameters and it should do the sync.

10. Add/modify files to the server directory (or, more likely, a subdirectory)
    and run .sync again. Note that you don't need to close the server.
    
11. The server only sends new files. To force sync of everything, delete
    the syncpoint.dat file that the server creates.
    
12. To close the server, either just close its window, or hit control-break.
    Control-c doesn't seem to work, at least in windows.
    
    
    
Troubleshooting:
    - When in doubt, cold boot, close server and restart it.

"Can't talk to esp" 
    - the wifi module is not in its default bit rate. Try cold boot (completely
      power off), or if you'd rather not, you can type
      .uart -f
      to reset the bit rate. To exit the '.uart' press symbol shift and space.
      
"Can't talk to esp fast"
    - Shouldn't happen. Do a cold boot and try again.

"Unable to connect"
    - Is the server running?
    - Is the server ip/name correct?
    - Is the server on the same network?
    - Is the next's wifi configured to be on the same network?
    - The server name is stored in c:/sys/config/nextsync.cfg

"Server version mismatch"
    - Use the same version of server and .sync

"Unable to open file"
    - Can happen if you're trying to sync sync itself, or if the files are open
      otherwise, write protected or broken or something else went wrong.

"Close failed"
    - Server probably closed the connection. Shouldn't happen.
